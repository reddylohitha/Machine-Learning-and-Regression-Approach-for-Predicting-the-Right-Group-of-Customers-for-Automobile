# Machine-Learning-and-Regression-Approach-for-Predicting-the-Right-Group-of-Customers-for-Automobile

## The automobile industry has advanced significantly, with manufacturers increasingly focused on predicting target customer #segments to tailor marketing, design products, and optimize inventory. Traditional methods like surveys and market #research provide insights but can be time-consuming and limited. Machine learning and regression techniques offer a more #accurate, data-driven alternative for identifying customer preferences. 

The project, "Machine Learning and Regression-Based Approach for Predicting Target Customer Segments," aims to revolutionize segmentation by analyzing demographic data, purchasing history, and market trends. This approach enables manufacturers to make data-driven decisions, improving sales, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

We choose a sample dataset (train.csv) for this project.

__We compared two ML models (KNN and random forest) to check which one gives most accurate predictions.__

We compiled and executed this project in Anaconda's Spyder environment in python 3.76 version.

A sample UI for predicting the right customer group provides a visual representation of the customer prediction process, featuring tools and functionalities for accurate segmentation.

A sample dataset for predicting the right customer group includes columns representing features and target variables for customer segmentation.

The UI showcases the dataset after preprocessing, including data split for training and testing. A count plot visualizes customer segmentation in the automobile industry, offering insights into distribution. The dataset analysis highlights key trends for predicting customer groups. 

Performance metrics for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model show 61% accuracy, 62% precision, recall, and F1-score. In contrast, the Random Forest model achieves 100% across all metrics, indicating superior performance. A comparison graph between KNN and Random Forest helps select the most effective model for customer segmentation. The prediction results of the Random Forest classifier are also displayed.
